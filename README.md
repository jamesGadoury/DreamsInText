# DreamsInText
My take on a text game. Written in Python. 

To play - 

	Linux: download Linux folder, double click on Dreams In Text executable

	Windows: download Windows folder, double click on Dreams In Text executable

The game is relatively simple, but rather punishing. I played a few textbased games (ZORK for example) and thought it would be a fun exercise to practice some object oriented programming with Python. I looked at the textbased games and thought about how I would go about developing my own and took it step by step. I enjoyed the process, and may later extend this to a longer full-fledged game if interest builds.
